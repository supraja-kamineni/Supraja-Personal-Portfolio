## About

I am a passionate UI/UX Designer and Java Developer. With a strong background in both design and development, I create innovative solutions that enhance user experience.

## Projects

### Mass Mail Dispatcher
Bulk mailing refers to managing and sending large quantities of mail at reduced rates. It's an incredibly useful tool for any business looking to expand and reach new customers while keeping costs as low as possible.

### Smart Voting System Using Facial Recognition
We proposed a digital voting system through facial recognition. This model has three levels of verification: unique number verification, voter card number, and various algorithms for facial recognition.
